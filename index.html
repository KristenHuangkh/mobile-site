        <p>
            The Flat Earth Society is a group actively promoting the Flat Earth Movement worldwide. Descending
            from Samuel
            Shenton's International Flat Earth Research Society, and the universal Zetetic Society before it, we
            continue the
            age-old tradition of questioning the Round Earth doctrine and challenging authorities.

            <p>
                Samuel Shenton, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Geographic Society, founded
                the Flat Earth Society in 1956, after renaming it from the Universal Zetetic Society. 
            </p>

            <p>
                He led the
                Flat Earth Society from its founding in 1956 until his death in 1971, at which time leadership
                passed to Charles K. Johnson. Shenton collected material, gave lectures and generated publicity for
                the Society so that by his death in 1971 the Society had over 100 members. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Flat Earth beliefs have had a notable recent resurgence since 2015, due to the internet. Since 2017, there are
                now over 500 members.
            </p>

            <p>
                Drawing from the society's founder, Samuel Shenton, our goal is to foster a community where we can discuss and challenge the mainstream scientific understanding the the Earth's shape.
