            Our Mission
        </h2> 

        <p>
            The Flat Earth Society holds that there is a difference between believing and knowing. If you don't know something, and cannot understand it by first principles, then you shouldn't believe it. We must, at the very least, know exactly how conclusions were made about the world, and the strengths and weaknesses behind those deductions. Our society emphasizes the demonstration and explanation of knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are three fundamental principles you need to understand before educating on the Flat Earth beliefs:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Don't believe in everything. Not even Aristotle.</li>
            <li>The Flat Earth theory is not a conspiracy. The only conspiracy is the moon landing.</li>
            <li>The Flat Earth has been proven by the government.</li>
        </ol>

            <p>
                Aristotle is credited as being the first to propose that the earth was round based on physical evidence. Several elements of Aristotle's physics were such that their acceptance as facts unquestionably inhibited authentic empirical investigation of nature. Yet, his ideas were so influential in the ancient and medieval world that in some cases it took scholars centuries even to object to Aristotelian concepts that could have easily be proven wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                Moreover, Aristotle arrived at his conclusions concerning physics apart from experimentation, instead relying solely on reason. Aristotle might have been all the more ignorant of the deeper secrets of nature. And wise men are now ignorant of many things which the common crowd of students will understand in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
                "Europe could not return from the depths of superstition and ignorance until it got past this man’s influence. The Enlightenment and its preceding Renaissance, in fact, represents the West finally throwing off of the iron shackles of Aristotelian thought after over a thousand years."

                There is no Flat Earth Conspiracy. This is a common misconception. It is the Flat Earth Theory. A theory is a principle that has been formed as an attempt to explain things that have already been substantiated by data. The only conspiracy is the faking of space travel.

                NASA is not hiding the shape of the earth from anyone. The purpose of NASA is not to 'hide the shape of the earth' or 'trick people into thinking it's round' or anything of the sort. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The purpose of NASA is to fake the concept of space travel to further America's militaristic dominance of space. That was the purpose of NASA's creation from the very start: To put ICBMs and other weapons into space (or at least appear to). The motto "Scientific exploration of new frontiers for all mankind" was nothing more than a front.

                As evidenced by the logo of the United Nations the Earth is a round disk of indefinite dimensions. The geographic North Pole is located in the center of the disk, and the Antarctic lies around the outer edges.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The Earth is in the form of a disk with the North Pole in the center and Antarctica as a wall surrounding the known continents. This is the generally accepted model among members of the society. In this model, circumnavigation is performed by moving in a great circle around the North Pole.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The Earth is surrounded on all sides by an ice wall that holds the oceans back. This ice wall is what explorers have named Antarctica. Beyond the ice wall is a topic of great interest to the Flat Earth Society.
